# Hyperskill_Last_Pencil_AI_Bot
**Last Pencil project from Hyperskill's Python Core course.** 

The game 'Last Pencil' can be played with any number of pencils. You can specify the number of pencils at the beginning of the game. On each move you must take at least one pencil and you can take no more than three. (Thus you have three legal moves: You may take 1 or 2 or 3 pencils.) The object of the game is to force your opponent to take the last pencil. The game is just that simple.

At the start of the game, you specify who will be the first to take pencils. If you choose John (player), you'll start the game. If you choose Jack (bot), the bot will start the game.
The bars (`|`) is representing the pencils.
